# ufsrv

The application server powering unfacd network, an emerging social network.

ufsrv provides a self-contained environment for managing and servicing distributed,
multi-user, concurrent and real-time communication. 
Whilst ufsrv is currently purpose-built for the needs of unfacd, it can be adapted for other needs, especially if you are targeting a scalable micro-services environment. The base server has direct built-in support for WebSockets, web-based API's, redis and MariaDB

## Getting Started

ufsrv is designed for distributed environments, so it is quite involved to setup. A typical scenario involves one-or-more instances of ufsrv, servicing one-or-more API endpoints, thus forming an asynchronous backend cluster. Also, utilising built-in WebSockets support it is possible to build a backend cluster of one-or-more stateful instances, using redis for transient caching and MariaDB for permenant storage.

Also, ufsrv has been previously used to build a TURN server. So really, any web-based service can be pulled together, building on ufrsv's foundational networking and concurrent servicing capabilities.

### Prerequisites

ufsrv is written entirely in c and the basic ufsrv has quite a number of package dependencies. The extract below is from [cmake's build file](https://github.com/unfacd/ufsrv/blob/github/src/CMakeLists.txt)

```
set_target_properties(utf8proc PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION "/opt/lib/libutf8proc.so")
set_target_properties(lua PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION "/opt/lib/liblua.a")
set_target_properties(json-c PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION "/opt/lib/libjson-c.so")
set_target_properties(curl PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION "/opt/lib/libcurl.a")
set_target_properties(ssl PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION "/opt/lib/libssl.a")
set_target_properties(crypto PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION "/opt/lib/libcrypto.a")
set_target_properties(mysqlclient PROPERTIES IMPORTED_LOCATION "/opt/lib/libmysqlclient.so")
```

## Deployment

To deploy this application server you have to have some distributed environment design in mind. It is possible to deploy a single-instance server environment, though, using appropriate parameters in the relevant config file.

In fact, the entire unfacd network has been "miniaturised" into docker, using docker compose, for development purposes.

The server is currently deployed on linux.

### Installing

Limited support is available at this stage.

## Acknowledgments

* ufsrv is primarily designed for the unfacd social network, 
where the canonical client software currently in use [unfacd android](https://github.com/unfacd/unfacd-android)  is based on a highly adapted 
version of the Open Whisper Systems' android client. unfacd is unaffiliated with Signal and code reuse is purely based on technical 
considerations and to facilitate rapid prototyping. Naturally, this choice did influence some tradeoffs in the design of ufsrv. However, it is worth
noting that ufsrv does not aim to implement the Signal protocol as a matter of design choice, nor is it necessarily compliant with it.

* Being open source, there are countless instances of code reuse. Those should be acknowledged within the codebase.
